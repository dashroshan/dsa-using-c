| Root | It is the top node in a tree. | A |
| Parent | A node that has one or more child nodes present below it is referred as parent node. | B is the parent node of D and E |
| Child | All nodes in a tree except the root node are child nodes of their immediate predecessor nodes. | H, I and J are child nodes of E |
| Leaf | It is the terminal node that does not have any child nodes. | G, H, I, J and F are leaf nodes |
| Internal node | All nodes except root and leaf nodes are referred as internal nodes. | B, C, D and E are internal nodes |
| Sibling | All the child nodes of a parent node are referred as siblings. | D and E are siblings |
| Degree | The degree of a node is the number of subtrees coming out of the node. | Degree of A is 2, degree of E is 3 |
| Level | All the tree nodes are present at different levels. Root node is at level 0, its child nodes are at level 1, and so on. | A is at level 0, B and C are at level 1, G, H, I, J are at level 3 |
| Depth or Height | It is the maximum level of a node in the tree. | Depth of tree T is 3 |
| Path | It is the sequence of nodes from source node till destination node. | A–B–E–J |
